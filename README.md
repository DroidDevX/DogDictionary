Overview: 
The main objective of this short experimental project is to use a Retrofit to perform REST API requests from a public webserver. Dog profiles are requested from this server and are displayed on the UI. A maximum of-hundred dog profile queries was done for this demo application
The simple UI design comprises of a search bar to perform search queries, and a view pager to display dog profile results. Furthermore, a master-view layout approach was taken into consideration when designing the UI to accommodate the dog profile data. Images, on the other hand, were loaded using the Picasso library
The MVVM architectural pattern together with Room was followed closely in terms of implementation. Background operations such as caching of REST API request data in SQLite were implemented using Android SDK classes such as Executor so they may executed asynchronously in a background thread.
